The world is full of complex systems like traffic patterns, cells, and packs of zombies. How can we answer questions about these wildly different systems using a single toolkit? Complexity science is a genre of data science that looks at how the interactions of individual components of system give rise to emergent patterns. By modeling individual components we can discover things like how to increase road capacity by 30% or which way to run if zombies were to attack. In the last 50 years, major jumps in methods and technology allow us to understand emergent behaviors of complex systems from biology to traffic networks. In this talk, Jackie will go over what complexity science is, how it fits in the ecosystem of data science, what tools exist in Python and how those relate to other tooling and approaches, and some of the practical applications.
