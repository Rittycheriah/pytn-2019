The world is complicated. As components interact new states emerge, and we can model the world’s complexity and emergence. By doing so, we can discover things like how to increase road capacity by 30% or which way to run if Zombies were to attack. In the last 50 years, major jumps in methods and technology that allow us to understand emergent behaviors of complex systems from biology to traffic networks. In this talk, Jackie will go over what complexity science is, how it fits in the ecosystem of data science, and some of the practical applications.
