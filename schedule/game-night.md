## PyTennessee 2019 Game Night Information

Over the past 3 years, the PyTennessee Game Night has become a staple of {{ site.data.event.short_name }}.
It's been such a hit in the past, we're bringing it back for another year.
So if you're looking for something to do with other PyTN attendees on Saturday evening after the conference, then look no further than the PyTN 2019 Game Night!

[Meeple Mountain](https://www.meeplemountain.com/) will provide all the table top games, PyTennessee provide the food and drink, and [Campaign Monitor](https://www.campaignmonitor.com/) is hosting and sponsorsing the whole thing. The only thing left is you! And in addition to providing table top games to play, Meeple Mountain will also have a few prizes to raffle off to the attendees.

So once you've had your fill of Python for the day, come downtown and enjoy some table top games, then head out to wherever the night takes you!

_Please note this is a ticketed event and only 100 tickets are made available._
