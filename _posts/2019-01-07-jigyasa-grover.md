**What have you been working on lately that you're excited about? (It can totally be non-tech related!)**

I used to read a lot of books till I was a teenager before the rat-race of learning all the chemical reactions, energy-mass equations and cell-organ structures caught me and I was drowned in studies till I was done with my Masters in Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence. After a break of 5+ years, I am working on reviving my appetite for reading books. So far, it is going great, it’s keeping me busy so much that I want to stay from my phone/laptop and oh dear, I love fiction !

**What are some of the learning resources you'd suggest to newcomers to the Python language?**

With information on our finger tips these days, there is no dearth of sources to learn from and it depends on each individual’s preferences. Personally, I prefer official documentations topped with personal blogs of developers and people experimenting with different applications of Python surmising a project for ideas.

**How hot do you like your hot chicken, and for how many meals are you going to eat it while you're here?**

Not everyday one gets to be in the land of hot chicken, so I am ready to live on a meal or two of hot chicken for each day I am there. C’mon, make it as hot as you can!

**Do you have any advice for getting the most out of a technology conference?**

Networking - is one of the keywords one should keep in mind while attending a technology conference especially like PyTennessee where you have speakers & attendees from so many diverse and experienced backgrounds. Mark your schedules with talks on topics you are currently working on, or wish to work in future to make the best out of the conference and talk to people. And in the madness of all the talks and networking, don’t forget to take a deep breath and enjoy all the fun activities conferences offer ;)

**Have you ever been to Nashville? If so, is there anything you recommend first timers do while they're here? If not, is there anything you're excited to see or do while you're here?**

So far, I have never been to the state of Tennessee and starting the exploration from Nashville is obviously a great idea. I am all pumped up to be touristy in this Music City, catch some country music in those historic auditoriums, visit some local craft breweries and also the cool ‘batman building’ I have seen in pictures. And of course, who can forget the Nashville Hot Chicken ?
