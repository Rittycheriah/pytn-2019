Grishma Jena is a PyTN conference speaker presenting not just one, but *two* tutorials: [A hands-on introduction to Natural Language Processing in Python](https://www.pytennessee.org/talks/a-handson-introduction-to-natural-language-processing-in-python "A hands-on introduction to Natural Language Processing in Python") and [Intro to Python](https://www.pytennessee.org/talks/intro-to-python "Intro to Python"). We are thrilled to have Grishma as a speaker, and share the enthusiasm for Python and PyTN 2019 below!

**What have you been working on lately that you're excited about?**

I'm a writer as part of this group that's creating a book to introduce Computer Science to middle-schoolers. We are planning to have stories with diverse, representative characters and explain the concepts in a fun manner. Apart from that, I have some public speaking sessions lined up in the next few months that I'm pretty excited about.

**What are some of the learning resources you'd suggest to newcomers to the Python language?**

Definitely recommend starting out with the official Python documentation which also includes a specific beginner's guide. Some other good references are Free Code Camp, W3 school, the online courses at Udemy, edX, Coursera, Khan Academy - there are a lot of them really. If you'd like a good hands-on introduction to Python, I'm conducting an 'Intro to Python' workshop at PyTennessee with fun mini-projects to practice our Python skills on.

**How hot do you like your hot chicken, and for how many meals are you going to eat it while you're here?**

I'm vegetarian so I won't be having any hot chicken but I'm hoping to find good vegetarian versions that I can try. Suggestions welcome!

**Do you have any advice for getting the most out of a technology conference?**

It's useful to check the schedule in advance and plan the sessions you would like to attend. Often times the sessions build upon each other or are related, so it helps when you know in advance what session could fill in some gaps or give you a refresher. You can create a nifty barcode that links to your website or your LinkedIn to quickly exchange information with people you would like to connect with. All in all, meet other people, take notes you can refer to later and most importantly, have fun! 

**Have you ever been to Nashville? If so, is there anything you recommend first timers do while they're here? If not, is there anything you're excited to see or do while you're here?**

This is my first visit to Nashville, to Tennessee infact. I'm looking forward to doing some 
sightseeing and eating some local delicacies. I'd appreciate recommendations on that!
