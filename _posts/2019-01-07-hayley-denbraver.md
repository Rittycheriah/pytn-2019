**What have you been working on lately that you're excited about? (It can totally be non-tech related!)**

Last year, I was putting a lot of effort into getting a job in Developer Relations. In December I found one, and now I have been diving into my new role and learning a lot about security and open source. 

**What's a way that you think the Python community has grown that you didn't expect? Where do you think the Python community/ecosystem could develop further?**

I love that the Python community is so diverse, not just in terms of representation of people but also in how people use Python in their work. Every time I go to a conference, I hear about how someone is using Python in an unexpected way. I love that. 

**What are some of the learning resources you'd suggest to newcomers to the Python language?**

The turtle module! Come see my talk on drawing in python. It is a good learning tool. 

**How hot do you like your hot chicken, and for how many meals are you going to eat it while you're here?**

This Californian is unsure how to answer. 

**Do you have any advice for getting the most out of a technology conference?**

Go to one talk that you are unsure you will like. You might be surprised. 

**Have you ever been to Nashville? If so, is there anything you recommend first timers do while they're here? If not, is there anything you're excited to see or do while you're here?**

I have never been to Nashville. I will be asking around for fun things to do.
