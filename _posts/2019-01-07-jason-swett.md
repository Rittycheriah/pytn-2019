Jason Swett is a PyTN conference speaker presenting a talk on [Using Tests as a Tool to Wrangle Legacy Projects](https://www.pytennessee.org/talks/using-tests-as-a-tool-to-wrangle-legacy-projects "Using Tests as a Tool to Wrangle Legacy Projects") at PyTN 2019. We are thrilled to have Jason as a speaker, and share the enthusiasm for Python and PyTN 2019 below!

**What have you been working on lately that you're excited about? (It can totally be non-tech related!)**

I’ve been teaching my eight-year-old son how to program using Python. I wasn’t sure if he wasn’t going to be into it but he’s finding it to be a lot of fun.

**How hot do you like your hot chicken, and for how many meals are you going to eat it while you're here?**

As with all foods, I like my hot chicken to be spicy enough to me projectile cry and give those around me serious concern for my well-being. I’m expecting to spend two days in Nashville which should be just enough time for about nineteen hot chicken meals.

**Do you have any advice for getting the most out of a technology conference?**

Talk to your fellow conference-goers. The “hallway track” is always my favorite part of any conference.

**Have you ever been to Nashville? If so, is there anything you recommend first timers do while they're here? If not, is there anything you're excited to see or do while you're here?**

I’m a big fan of outlaw country music. I’m hoping to find some sort of country music museum or something like that.
