We’re building Juicebox, a platform that will let anyone build and publish data-rich applications. Data is most valuable when people can interact with it, socialize it, and easily see how to act on it.

At Juice, we use Python/Django and AWS. I wish I could tell you more about the backbone of our tech stack. Let’s just say we sweat the d3tails, but always retain enough Salt in our diet. Do we chatops? You better believe it.

Thanks to all the wonderful volunteers at PyTennessee! If you’re passionate about data, we’d love to meet you.
