NSS is a flourishing community of 700+ alumni, 100+ active students, and a team of dedicated instructors helping each other grow and learn their craft. Nashville employers and mentors who give back to our community and support future tech talent are vital to our success.

We prepare adults with aptitude, motivation, and drive for careers in software development, UI/UX design, and data science.

We are committed to growing diversity in these fields by creating opportunities for underrepresented groups in tech.
